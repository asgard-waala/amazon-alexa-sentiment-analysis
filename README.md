# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews. The script utilizes machine learning models to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their content.

## Functionality

The script performs the following tasks:

1.  Imports necessary libraries for data processing and analysis.
2.  Loads the Amazon reviews dataset from a CSV file.
3.  Performs exploratory data analysis by displaying dataset information, descriptive statistics, and visualizations.
4.  Cleans the review messages by removing punctuation and stopwords.
5.  Creates word cloud visualizations for positive and negative reviews.
6.  Prepares the data for training the machine learning models.
7.  Trains and evaluates a Naive Bayes classifier.
8.  Trains and evaluates a Logistic Regression classifier.
9.  Trains and evaluates a Gradient Boosting classifier.
10.  Generates classification reports and confusion matrices for each trained classifier.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.
2.  Ensure that the required libraries are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Download the dataset file `amazon_reviews.csv` and place it in the same directory as the script.
4.  Run the script `sentiment_analysis.py` using Python: `python sentiment_analysis.py`.
5.  View the classification reports and confusion matrices generated by the script.
